SHAH ALAM  City Link Express  M  Sdn Bhd  which has an annual turnover of more than RM   mil  is mulling over a listing on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia within the next three years Besides being able to tap into the equity market to raise funds  the company also hopes to further strengthen confidence among its investors  stakeholders and customers by being a listed entity  Being a listed entity will further boost customers  confidence in us  especially when we want to penetrate South East Asian markets that we are not in yet   said founder and managing director Datuk David Tan He said the company s domestic arm was still the main income contributor but it aimed to grow its presence in the region Currently  beyond Malaysia  it has operations in Singapore  Thailand  Indonesia  Vietnam  Hong Kong and China Tan said the firm planned to grow its business in South East Asian countries as well as penetrate new markets in the region as overseas contribution to the group was relatively small compared with its domestic market  We are talking to bankers and have shortlisted a few for the initial public offering  However  it is still preliminary to disclose further   he said Asked about its competitive edge  Tan said the company had been growing organically for the past    years and that it would use the proceeds from the listing to invest in technology and infrastructure to better serve its customers City Link commands a     market share of the domestic courier service in Malaysia It started as a courier company and later expanded into other services such as third party warehousing and counts several multinational companies as its clients Tan opined that the nascent stage of e commerce in the region provided vast opportunity for a boom of online shopping that would further boost demand for courier services Asked if the current weak market conditions would defer its listing plans  chief operating officer Ronald Tan said   We will definitely wait for the right time to list  When the economy is bad  a lot of people will suffer but some will gain  He added that consumers might then turn to online to hunt for bargains and that would benefit them On top of that  a low crude oil price environment bodes well for the company s profit margins At the moment  there were more business to business delivery but he expected more business to customer deliveries going forward Moreover  its regional plan would enable it to counter the slowdown in any one particular market Its RM   mil integrated hub in Bandar Saujana Putra  which is about    times bigger than its existing facility at the Glenmarie Industrial Park  is expected to boost its revenue by at least      The new    ha hub features a fully automated sorting system City Link Express senior regional manager  Sabah and Sarawak  Pei Wee Shiung  second left  pointing to the bundles of clothes at their warehouse  With him are Coryina  left  and project coordinator Nur Habibah Wasli KUCHING  A courier service company will be setting up collection centres at selected premises beginning today for donors to drop off their relief aid for flood victims in the East Coast City Link Express Sarawak said they will be setting up a collection centre at City Link Express building at Jalan Datuk Abang Abdul Rahim and a drop off point at the shophouse opposite St Paul s school in Jalan Green here Outside Kuching  the collection centres will be at their offices in Bintulu at Jalan Tun Ahmad Zaidi  Sibu at Kingwood Hotel  Lorong Lanang   and Miri at Jalan Miri By pass  Eastwood Valley  Each of our collection centres will be open from     am to  pm while the drop off point at Jalan Green will be open from     am to  pm   said City Link Express branch executive Coryina Slimin to The Borneo Post yesterday She also said prior to the public donation drive  City Link Express staff in Kuching had also done their bit by collecting items since last week  We have also come to know that the public are rather clueless as to where they can drop off their donations for the flood victims  that is why we are setting up these collection centres   she added The collection centres  she added  will only operate until Friday as all the donated items have to be properly packed and sent off to the East Coast by the next day She also said donors are required to separate the donated items accordingly to avoid them getting spoilt during transportation and for easy distribution Among the items which are most needed by the flood victims are rice  canned food  instant noodles  cooking oil  milk powder  baby and adult diapers  candles  soaps  broom sticks  everyday clothing and blankets The cost to transport the donated items will be fully borne by the company For enquiries  please call their offices in Kuching at             Bintulu               Sibu              and Miri              Pos Malaysia Bhd had told people to post their parcels preferably before May    so that they will reach their intended recipient before Hari Raya  Bernama File PhotoKUALA LUMPUR  It cannot be denied that the courier service has become a vital connector for Malaysians in a time of enforced isolation due to COVID    and the Conditional Movement Control Order  CMCO  It has become a lifeline especially to those celebrating Aidilfitri who are living apart from family and cannot balik kampung  return home  because of the government s interstate travel ban  and instead await a special Hari Raya delivery A higher parcel volume would have therefore been expected yet people still kept patronising courier services and ended up feeling dissatisfied when expectations were not met and parcels were delivered late In view of the situation  GD Express Sdn Bhd  GDEX  chief executive officer  Caren Chong Hui Chuen  posted a  reminder  on the company s website on May   to tell clients that there would be a peak period delivery delay starting May    She said that the courier s parcel pick up service would operate as normal  but that delivery to locations throughout Malaysia would take a longer time With the holiday period now over  we can see delivery vehicles zipping around to ensure that parcels reach their destination promptly and clients  expectations are met again City Link Express put out a similar notice on May    to alert clients of the very high parcel volume because of the CMCO and long stretch of public holidays Their message to customers read   However  we are still committed to providing service to the best of our ability  Thank you for your patience and continuous support  We will do our very best to have your shipments delivered as soon as we can  Pos Malaysia Bhd  too  told people to post their parcels preferably before May    so that they will reach their intended recipient before Hari Raya A City Link Express employee who only wanted to be known as Danny told Bernama  however  that almost    per cent of the parcels sent through the company s Jenjarom branch reached their destination at the peak of Aidilfitri  We expect the rest to be sent out by this week  Clients should understand that their items have not gone missing or astray  but because there are damaged items  they need to be returned to the seller for a replacement  The damage is because the shipper has defiantly sent a prohibited item  like glass  so clients shouldn t get mad that the courier service is slow  inefficient and so on  There are actually a lot of challenges to deal with to ensure a damage free delivery   Danny said Line Clear Express   Logistics Sdn Bhd client  Suziela Che Mat  said she sent a box containing food and kuih Raya to her husband who was unable to be together with her because of the travel ban  I sent it on May   from Ampang  Selangor  and it reached him in Butterworth  Penang  on May     That s fast and I m happy it reached before Aidilfitri  At least it can help reduce his feelings of homesickness   she said But many have not been as lucky as Suziela  and based on the comments on social media  dissatisfaction with the courier service is evident Many  too  left the parcel tracking number for the courier company social media manager to update them with a parcel delivery status  which was duly performed The Federation of Malaysian Consumer Associations  FOMCA  president  Datuk Dr Marimuthu Nadason  said the public should pick a company they can trust and practise patience at peak periods like the festive season  We ve received complaints almost every day and we ve found that people are using less popular courier services because they are cheaper and so on  Just go for a reliable courier service  We ve received almost     to     complaints per month  but what about those that go unreported   he said While recourse is available through the Tribunal for Consumer Claims Malaysia  TTPM   Dr Marimuthu recommends people use a courier company that has a proper parcel tracking system and  avoid patronising the less popular and cheaper services  ,"{'shah': 1, 'alam': 1, 'city': 9, 'link': 9, 'express': 10, 'm': 2, 'sdn': 3, 'bhd': 5, 'which': 4, 'has': 6, 'an': 1, 'annual': 1, 'turnover': 1, 'of': 22, 'more': 3,

'https://www.thestar.com.my/opinion/letters/2019/04/17/delivery-by---poslaju-needs-to-be-improved/']",Poslaju customers in East Malaysia are urged to be patient while waiting for their parcel MIRI  Poslaju customers in East Malaysia are urged to be patient with the longer waiting time  as the national courier is experiencing a surge of parcel volume during the recovery phase of movement control order  RMCO  The Borneo Post had recently reached out to the national courier through its Sarawak representative  following complaints by dissatisfied customers on pending parcels delivery and long queues In response  the spokesperson yesterday explained that Poslaju is taking all the measures to maximise capacity  to ensure deliveries are carried out as soon as possible  We process all items using the  First In  First Out  Fifo   system  to ensure that deliveries are done systematically  Any delays due to limited availability of flights are unexpected  thus we seek the kind understanding and patience of our customers   the spokesperson said As the demand for parcel delivery has soared after the country had entered the fifth phase of MCO  Pos Malaysia has been deploying part timers    Pos Riders    to help with parcel deliveries during this time and has also increased its back end sorting resources to ensure deliveries can be carried out as soon possible Pos Malaysia Group s initiative to scale up its last mile delivery through crowd sourcing is gaining traction with more than    per cent increase in crowd sourced riders compared to the quarter ended    December      This initiative runs parallel to the Group s Entrepreneurship Programme  which was launched in February       aiming at converting full time delivery personnel to become Pos Malaysia s delivery partners As for the complaints it has received  particularly on the variable quality of services from one office to another  Poslaju thanks the public for the feedback and furthermore appreciates it  as it helps Pos Malaysia to improve its products and services  We hope the public understand that different post offices handle different number of parcels and customers  High parcel volume and customer traffic may cause unexpected issues such as longer waiting times  long queues and others  In view of the increasing demand  we always strive to improve our touchpoints to enhance customer experience  such as through the integration of digital technology to improve the way we operate and interact with our customers  easing business transactions and many more  It also reminds customers to always update their delivery addresses  for smooth delivery Customers are welcome to use AskPos via Pos Malaysia website at www pos com my should they have any enquiries regarding Pos Malaysia products or services  or to update their delivery address for redirection purposes Unlocking consumer value through its continuous foray into digitalisationTO manage the change in trends in terms of consumer s buying behaviour and to remain competitive  companies need to keep up with the times That said  Pos Malaysia s new digital platform SendParcel by Pos Laju is hoping to achieve two million parcels monthly by       Pos Laju SendParcel was launched over a year ago to support the changing trend in customer buying behaviour from physically going to retail stores to buying goods online    said Pos Malaysia Group chief executive officer Syed Md Najib  Our courier business is a key segment that generates sustainable revenue for Pos Malaysia but the problem then was  we were still conducting business the conventional way by requiring customers to walk in to our Pos Laju outlets  while other businesses were online and required quick turnaround due to the high demand from customers  The number of registered users surpassed        subscribers within a year and from October      to July       Pos Laju SendParcel has successfully shipped more than     million parcels in total and generated RM    mil in revenue Pos Malaysia aims to achieve a revenue of RM  mil by the end of this year The establishment of the online shipping platform was indeed timely as Pos Malaysia would not have survived the movement control order restrictions during the initial stages of the Covid    pandemic With a substantial increase in online purchases during that time  Pos Laju SendParcel provided the right platform to deliver customer purchases right to their home addresses Syed added that Pos Malaysia went full steam ahead into its digitalisation and transformation plans to unlock value for its customers  tapping into the booming e commerce market while meeting evolving customer demands Embracing digital innovation is also the only way to improve service efficiency and enhance customer experience  The rapid adoption of technology has brought about new challenges to our business and Pos Malaysia knew that it must adapt to digitalisation  to remain relevant in the industry and fulfil the changing behaviour of our customers  Concurrently  Pos Malaysia saw the arrival of global players with huge fundings and technological capabilities Therefore  it was a race against time for Pos Malaysia s team to face the challenge at hand to bring forward a solid digital proposition into the market  We knew that we needed to act fast to avoid being irrelevant in the industry  The pressure was high  but we were confident that the team would be able to create a digital platform that could compete and excel in the market    he added Try SendParcel today for the ultimate consumer experience Pos Laju SendParcel was introduced to the public in August       providing the desired customer convenience  particularly for small and medium enterprises  SMEs  Apart from    hour access and fast order placements  customers are offered best parcel rates  instant pricing quotes  free pick up service  auto generated consignment note including ease of shipment reporting and tracking In January       Pos Malaysia expanded the service by offering international deliveries to more than     countries worldwide  connecting local SMEs and e commerce businesses with overseas markets  By enhancing our reach internationally through Pos Laju SendParcel  Malaysian businesses can connect with international clients and expand their footprint across the globe  while enjoying affordable rates  Pos Malaysia remains committed to providing convenience and opening new frontiers and opportunities for customers    Syed said As for PosLaju SendParcel offerings  Syed said that Pos Malaysia aims to improve their services even further via constant feedback from users to ensure that Pos Malaysia continues to provide the best customer experience To complement the Pos Laju SendParcel service  Pos Malaysia also introduced automation and other digital enhancements to ensure safe and timely deliveries To date  Pos Malaysia has    distribution centres fitted with semi automated sorting systems which reduces manual workload and streamline workflow for maximum efficiency  Pos Malaysia will also install four additional distribution centres with the semi automated sorting systems by end of this year Pos Malaysia has seen immediate benefits to its processing capacity and speed where it is now able to process     more items   bringing down the total processing time by one to two hours per day   enabling the company to be on track with its aim to process one million parcels daily by the end of       We will continue on our investment efforts to exceed customer expectations through a robust and scalable digital platform    Syed concluded For more information  click here  RECENTLY  I ordered an item online which was to be shipped by PosLaju  When I arrived home a few days later  I saw the  dreaded  slip from PosLaju stating that an attempt had been made to deliver the package but no one was around to receive it  I say dreaded because it s not the first time this has happened to me  Why can t the PosLaju personnel call before delivering the package  Most courier services send a text message or call the customer to provide the estimated time of delivery to ensure that someone is around to receive the package   I called the PosLaju customer service to track down the delivery person  only to be told that it does not have direct contact with its courier personnel  I feel the delivery personnel should leave their contact number on the notification slip so that customers could call them  As it was  I could only call after     pm to ask where my package was   This management and operational method is completely bizarre and impractical in this day and age  Where businesses everywhere are improving on customer service  PosLaju seems to have this lackadaisical attitude where the aim is to just perform the basic duties and efficiency is not a matter for concern   With simple enhancements to its communication and logistical procedures  PosLaju could reduce the chances of unreachable parcels and save everyone s time  Please  let us put more seriousness into our work and make Malaysia a better place  LOH JIA MINKuala Lumpur,"{'poslaju': 11, 'customers': 15, 'in': 20,

implement secure and real time tracking of medication delivery DOC US  which is a telemedicine provider approved by the Health Ministry to provide digitally signed e prescription services  said the strategic tie up would enable the group to provide a one stop solution for patients  from digital healthcare and pharmaceutical supplies to logistics  This strategic collaboration between DOC US  Alpro Pharmacy  and GDEX will not only enhance our back end processes and productivity  but most importantly  provides a better patient experience when it comes to medication delivery services    chief executive officer of DOC US  Raymond Choy  said in a statement  We are confident of a safer provision of healthcare service  which is now more personal yet professional  In turn  we are able to set a higher standard in medication delivery in Malaysia    he added Once patients receive the e prescription from doctors at DOC US after consultation  pharmacists at Alpro Pharmacy will then fill the prescription  the companies said For patients who opt for doorstep delivery of their medication  they can track their barcoded medication shipments from GDEX in real time  to better time their availability in receiving their medication  it added  Our courier staff have been internally trained to handle the delivery and manage the storage of medication  Coupled with our barcoded tracking system  we are able to ensure that the right medication is delivered to the right patient  and most importantly  in the right condition    GDEX chief operating officer Caren Chong said Choy said there were currently more than     authorised pharmacies adopting the group s electronic prescribing dispensing solutions and it was targeting to onboard       pharmacy outlets this year to further shorten the delivery time nationwide  Gradually  we will also offer this seamless medication delivery service to all of our authorised pharmacies this year  At present  we offer same day delivery for minor ailments in seven major areas   the Klang Valley  Penang  Seremban  Melaka  Johor Baru  Kota Kinabalu and Kuching    he said GDEX s long term industry prospect remains bright  analysts opine  particularly as online shopping continues to grow with potential to rival the size and scale of brick and mortar retailers in Malaysia KUCHING  GD Express Carrier Bhd s  GDEX  long term industry prospect remains bright  analysts opine  particularly as online shopping continues to grow with potential to rival the size and scale of brick and mortar retailers in Malaysia With more consumers incorporating online purchases as part of their shopping habit  the research arm of MIDF Amanah Investment Bank Bhd  MIDF Research  believed that the industry in on track for expansion  This in turn will bode well for logistics players as increasing demand will contribute positively to GDEX s financial performance   MIDF Research said  Furthermore  our view is that online shopping is here to stay and will continue to grow with potential to rival the size and scale of brick and mortar retailers in Malaysia  On another note  MIDF Research recalled that GDEX s wholly owned subsidiary GDSB received an approval letter from the Malaysian Investment Development Authority  MIDA  for the second round of tax incentive  This is to carry out Integrated Logistics Services  ILS  activities as an expansion project and e commerce or e fulfilment diversity project  The tax incentive is one of the initiatives introduced by the Government to enhance the capabilities of logistics services providers  in line with The Logistics and Trade Facilitation Masterplan  introduced by Ministry of Transportation back in       At this juncture  the management has yet to quantify the expected amount of tax saving from the incentive as the details are still pending disclosures and negotiation with MIDA  Earlier on  MIDF Research had estimated and assessed the potential savings from the incentive To reiterate  the research arm estimated the tax impact to uplift the financial year           forecast  FY  F FY  F  earnings by      per cent and     per cent This was derived by estimating tax exemption at    per cent statutory income  MIDF Research used profit before tax  PBT  as statutory income approximation  and multiplied it with corporate tax rate at    per cent  per the research arm s assumption  However  this estimate remains subjected to further disclosure from the management  Overall  MIDF Research gathered that GDEX s lean balance sheet with a net cash position of above RM    million has supported the group s various expansion plans  This includes the acquisition of a      per cent stake in PT SAP Express  and the acquisition of    per cent stake in a Vietnamese company  Meanwhile  valuation remains stretched at a    month trailing price to earnings ratio of       fold compared to the average industry of approximately      fold  The research arm believed that other non listed players such as Ninja Van and J T will remain as a threat in the next two to three years as these companies continue to aggressively grabbing market share  Furthermore  despite our positivity on the impact of the tax scheme  we maintain our call on the company  This is premised on the recent price surge that we deemed has accounted for the tax scheme  All factors considered  MIDF Research maintained its  neutral  stance on GDEX at this juncture HOMEGROWN parcel delivery giant GD Express Carrier Bhd s  GDex  does not need much introduction Its brand has been visible to consumers throughout the country for the last    years And for the investment community  GDex has given its early investors spectacular returns since its listing in      However  going forward  the last mile delivery space has been decimated by intense competition  not helped by the aggressive issuance of licences by the Malaysian authorities as well as the entry of large foreign players throwing prices to earn market share Against this backdrop  GDex is embarking its own re transformation to rejuvenate its systems and processes   beginning with a new philosophy  to scale to new heights Teong was firm in his conviction that Malaysia would follow suit in the e commerce boom that unfolded in the United States and Japan  as he set out to make GDex the local multinational express carrier of choice  meeting the needs of its customers in parcel delivery and fulfillment services GDex was established in      as a small courier service provider focusing on document delivery When managing director and group CEO Teong Teck Lean first entered GDex as a controlling shareholder in       many had regarded it as an unconventional move for Teong to buy into a loss making company Being an engineer by training and subsequently a stockbroker with OSK Securities dealing with institutional clients  the logistics ecosystem was a whole new world for Teong But  Teong was firm in his conviction that Malaysia would follow suit in the e commerce boom that unfolded in the United States and Japan  as he set out to make GDex the local multinational express carrier of choice  meeting the needs of its customers in parcel delivery and fulfillment services  I had friends and acquaintances asking me if I was out of my mind to leave my investment banking job for GDex  which was then making losses  When I entered GDex  I was expecting the e commerce boom to happen in Malaysia soon  but little did I know that it would take more than    years    says Teong His perseverance and tenacity played a part in driving GDex on the road to recovery and thereafter  growth He overhauled GDex s business model along with his team  turning the company s financials into the black Five years later  GDex was successfully listed on the Ace Market of Bursa Malaysia However  Teong notes that it took the entry of Singapore Post as a substantial shareholder of GDex in       for the market to begin recognising GDex as a serious player in the last mile delivery space In       Japan s Yamato Asia entered as another strategic partner of GDex  stoking renewed interest in the market To date  GDex has expanded its presence and network to Singapore  Indonesia and Vietnam GDex prides itself as a player that consistently provides services without much disruption  in spite of challenges For example  the recent movement control order  MCO  had resulted in grounded passenger flights Undeterred  GDex chartered flights to the main cities in Sabah and Sarawak and relied on its linehaul to ensure that there was no disruption for deliveries to the two states Additionally  GDex continued to deliver to other parts of the world  while providing real time parcel tracking services globally through its international partners At GDex s headquarters in the heart of Petaling Jaya  Teong shares about the group s renewed vigour to take on what the new decade brings and his aspiration for GDex to be a regional player StarBizWeek  Why is there a need for GDex to have a new philosophy Teong  I believe a company s philosophy shapes the work culture When the two components are intact  a company can pretty much run on its own GDex s previous philosophy was set in       so there is a need for a transformation now  to take into account new trends and ways of running the business Some of the key considerations that GDex has to prepare for in the next decade are scalability  being more mobile and better serving the community With new startups entering the industry  we do not want to be complacent  we want to be ahead of the curve Hence  we need to be competitive in order to deliver customer expectations What does the new philosophy encompass The new philosophy comprises core values  management principles  corporate qualities and goal Corporate qualities is also how the GDex brand is perceived by the market  we strive to be the brand that is cost effective  reliable and speedy The pillars of GDex s corporate qualities are  P s and  S  namely People  Process  Platform  Product and Speed Our People  employees  are the most important assets as competent people execute strategies  plans and processes efficiently to make the business thrive Additionally  our Process has to be thoroughly planned and streamlined in order to be more cost effective Our Platform and Product must also be reliable to provide transparent and consistent results  which will lead to quality service The Platform and Product should include scalability and innovative features to meet customers  expectations As we learn to move fast and maintain speed to stay productive  a culture of Speed will naturally be formed within the company What are the changes that GDex needs to make  What new products and services can we expect from GDex Over the past five to six years  we have been making changes in our abilities to serve our evolving customer base  particularly with the emergence of ecommerce platform players We see a requirement for greater system integration via a more seamless application programming interface  API  with real time tracking As for products and services  we will have to cater to our customers  needs and be an all in one solutions provider  going forward We plan to grow our suite of offerings to include specific solutions such as insurance and technology For starters  we expect more demand for insurance products as there is growing confidence of customers delivering higher value products through last  mile delivery providers There is also a need to integrate worldwide parcel tracking derived from our network of international partners  into GDex s API system Besides that  GDex can perform cash collection services  or even payment collections via ewallet and other payment systems GDex  as an order fulfillment partner  can assist businesses in managing inventories  by handling shipping  warehousing and order processing To achieve this  GDex will work on enhancing our customs clearance ability as well as refining the APU platform to link the processes from fulfillment centre to last mile delivery  with seamless reporting Each of the tasks has its respective roadmap  spearheaded by a team of business development personnel Given the need for greater digitalisation and adoption of new technology  what is the value of investment or capital expenditure that GDex is allocating each year We have been allocating more capex since two years ago and we intend to set aside more funds as things speed up Our allocation for capex amounts to RM mil to RM mil each year As GDex embraces and gets on board with cloud and mobile app capabilities  we will concurrently maintain our legacy system for our customers who have been well accustomed to the legacy system We understand that the digital conversion journey will need easing in  hence  we will ensure that the digital platform is user friendly and offers rebate incentives for our customers to go onboard GDex s digital platform What is the breakdown of GDex s customer base today  Do the business to business  B B  customers continue to make up the majority of GDex s customers The line that separates our B B customers and business to consumer  B C  customers have blurred as businesses are increasingly combining both offline and online strategies For example  a company that previously sells its products through     stockists has today downsized to    stockists and sells directly to consumers via ecommerce platforms The online shift of businesses was also expedited during the MCO The segment of pure B B customers has shrunk  and by estimations  B C probably makes up     of GDex s business compared with     previously What is the biggest challenge for the local last mile delivery industry The most dire challenge is the price dumping for parcel deliveries by new startups who want to chomp up market share GDex is unfazed by this  We will not engage in a price war and GDex shall maintain its focus on providing specific and customised solutions Our promise is quality of service and value for money   that is sustainable for us and beneficial to our customers Businesses have to operate sustainably in order to not only survive  but grow As such  I believe unreasonable competition will phase out over time Apart from that  there is now a neutral body to oversee the logistics industry  as the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission  MCMC  has recently granted permission to the Association of Malaysian Express Carriers  Amec  to hire a full time chief secretariat to manage a postal forum that will encompass regulators  consumers and industry players What do you see as the future of last mile delivery in Malaysia Convergence  Not just amongst last mile delivery players  but the convergence with other businesses and industries Essentially  GDex is in a business that serves a large group of customers   we serve the population  the community Just like telecommunications  banking  technology  payments and social commerce  these are businesses that work with each other and revolve around the community Hence  I see convergence amongst these businesses and I believe partnerships among the players could be formed in the near future  This is already happening in the United States  Software giant Microsoft has inked a memorandum of understanding to work with last mile delivery provider FedEx Are mergers and acquisitions on the cards for GDex in the near term The Covid    pandemic and MCO have certainly stalled our growth plans  but GDex continues to be on the lookout for opportunities in the region  with a focus on the larger economies in Asean GDex first set up operations in Singapore back in      In

a huge part of our lives  with it being more convenient for consumers to purchase and receive their goods   from the comfort of their home That said  up and coming logistics start up J T Express recently concluded its            mega sales fiesta with a solid elevenfold increase in delivery volume as compared in       The logistics company also successfully recorded a       completion rate for its deliveries during that period  This marks a huge milestone for J T Express as it sailed through the storm to improve their shipping services  while having been around for only a year Their fervency is timely as a recent survey revealed that Malaysia has the longest e commerce delivery time in South east Asia  However  to J T Express  what is viewed as a problem  is an opportunity for growth  This is especially true with the rise and development of the digital economy even as major e commerce platforms such as Shopee rally with back to back sales campaigns during this year end period with                   and        More retailers are also making the move online to boost sales in this digital era to supplement their brick and mortar stores and channels According to the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission  MCMC   e commerce in Malaysia is expected to increase to      by      as affordable smartphones and internet data are easily accessible  Not to mention  e marketplaces are quickly becoming a lifestyle destination for shoppers as it moves away from pure trading by incorporating interactive shopping experiences through entertainment such as gaming  point collection  live broadcasts streaming and more J T Express employees are ready to serve customers with a premium quality service  With mega discounts for branded items on e marketplaces  consumers were seen clicking away and J T Express worked round the clock to deliver those parcels nationwide including Sabah and Sarawak As a fairly new but long term player in the e commerce support industry  this economic expansion runs parallel with J T Express  growth  In a short period  J T Express has scaled up to     drop points nationwide and now provides job opportunities to over       employees across    operating gateways   making J T Express more accessible to all Malaysians and businesses J T Express also estimates a    times surge in volume for the upcoming       sales period as compared to last year s       sale  Last year  the challenge for J T Express was to deliver large amounts of parcel within the promised time frame   which is two to four days within the Peninsular region and two to five days for orders in East Malaysia  Back then  having been in the industry for only three months  J T Express still managed to deliver     of the parcels within the stipulated delivery time frame  Out of the          was delivered the next day within Klang Valley and the remaining     was completed within three days across Klang Valley and East Malaysia  All these were made possible due to a strategic transportation schedule and efficient sorting system In addition  J T Express expects to be handling up to     more parcels in a single day this       as compared to      s       sale  In order to cope with the surge in orders  J T Express has developed a master plan derived from key learnings  and through consultation and input from stakeholders like Shopee J T Express works closely with one of its stakeholders   Shopee to receive feedback from buyers and sellers to improve on its services  This includes order forecasts which helps J T Express to grow and allocate higher resource such as manpower  infrastructure  commercials  outsourced air cargo capacity service and more  This would see employees including transit hubs working round the clock on rotation  hundreds of trucks being deployed and on the go    hours a day with additional drop point s dispatchers working  even on weekends This allows J T Express to plan ahead and achieve a more efficient and speedy delivery for the upcoming       fiesta sale  While being confident that it will be able to provide a premium quality service  the logistics company is striving to cross borders and push boundaries in the industry However  the bigger challenge still remains   the ability to process and deliver the increase in amounts of parcel to customers living in the rural areas with incomplete addresses or infrastructures J T Express Malaysia chief executive officer Roy Zeng said   We are confident with the growth of J T Express in Malaysia  With e commerce growing so rapidly in Malaysia  the pie is still big  By banking on this sector to propel our growth  J T Express is ready and confident to conquer the       courier express delivery  Commenting on J T Express  growth and foresight  Shopee regional managing director Ian Ho said   E commerce marketplaces cannot exist without strong infrastructure and commitment from the e commerce support industries  This includes third party logistics players like J T Express  By working closely with all our stakeholders  to create a feedback loop from both buyers and sellers  this helps to highlight specific areas for improvement  He added   These steps will help the entire e commerce industry to move forward even as Shopee and its partners such as J T Express work to provide great service to our buyers and sellers  Together with J T Express  we are all geared up for the       Big Sale  Malaysians can expect only the best from us in terms of deals  promos and  of course  shipping  For further information and latest updates

right  shakes hands with Mok yesterday during an event announcing the partnership between DHL eCommerce and Shopee Malaysia    Bernama photoKUALA LUMPUR  DHL eCommerce  a division of Deutsche Post DHL Group  has signed a partnership with Shopee Malaysia to boost its growth in Malaysia DHL eCommerce Southeast Asia managing director Kiattichai Pitpreecha said since its launch in Malaysia in April       the company has grown     per cent and expects the growth trend would continue  Currently  the group has less than    per cent market share in Malaysia and we are boosting efforts to expand the customer base by partnering with all interested parties   he told reporters after announcing the partnership yesterday Shopee head of operations Esten Mok said the partnership would allow sellers on Shopee Malaysia to ship their goods via DHL with next day deliveries to    per cent of zip codes across Malaysia and two to three days in other remote areas  The e commerce industry cannot exist without a strong and efficient logistics system as it is a crucial part of the entire online shopping process  As a platform with    million users and a rapidly growing user base  the partnership with DHL would help strengthen our value proposition to meet changing user demands   he saidKiattichai said the compound annual growth rate of e commerce in Malaysia was expected to be around    per cent from         and total retail market share to increase from     per cent to     per cent in       The growth of e commerce in Malaysia is dampened by a quality gap in delivery which impacts the confidence of consumers  Delivery played a big role in the entire e commerce experience where    per cent of consumers considered delivery as part of their online shopping experience and    per cent will not shop with a retailer after a bad experience   he added For the first quarter of       Shopee s regional growth tripled to       million gross orders with a gross merchandise value of US     billion  US     RM      compared with      million orders valued at US     million in the same period last year    Bernama,"{'from': 23, 'second': 1, 'left': 1, 'dhl': 56, 'express': 21, 'head': 2,
